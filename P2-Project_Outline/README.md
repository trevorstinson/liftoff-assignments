## Book Tracker

### Overview
I love reading, but when I'm not tracking my activity it's easy to go weeks or months without getting into a book. Goodreads provides a goals feature, but it's limited: one time period (annual) and one metric (books). I sometimes find myself choosing shorter books over longer books simply to make sure I reach my goal.

My project will provide readers with customizable goals. Readers can choose their own time period and their own metric so that the built-in parameters of their goal tracker are not determining their behavior.

### Features
- **User accounts**: Each user will have their own book collection, stacks, and tags.
- **Books**: Users can import book data from Amazon, add a book to a stack (read, to-read, reference) and add custom tags (nonfiction, star-wars, read-for-class)
- **Goals**: Users can create goals with custom time periods and metrics such as word count, page count, books, or books with or without specific tags.
- **Logging**: Users can log when they have started or stopped reading a book, as well as how much of it they read (so that partial books can still count towards page count goals).

### Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- Thymeleaf
- JavaScript and/or Vue
- Amazon APIs for book search and info

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will use the Amazon API to look up books and import book details. I would also like to see if the Goodreads API can provide a way to push activity to Goodreads so that users do not feel like they are missing out by using this book tracker. I already know JavaScript basics, but I would like to apply that knowlege in new ways to increase interactivity. For example, I could build a tool to help estimate a books' word count when Amazon is missing that information. I would like to use Vue for the JavaScript elements of the app.
